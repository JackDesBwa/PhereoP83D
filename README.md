PhereoRoll3D
============

I was frustrated to not be able to use native autostereoscopic capabilities of my ELEPHONE P8 3D to watch stereophotographs of Phereo website ; so I made this app to display them nicely. Some other display modes were added afterwards.

Status: Proof of concept â€” It is working and I might improve depending of my needs (patches are welcome)

Usage
-----

The defaults parameters are set so that when the phone is in landscape orientation, the app displays itself in column-interleaved to be seen in 3D thanks to autostereoscopic display. You can use other type of 3D thanks to other display modes.

The app opens "Popular" list at startup.
