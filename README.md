PhereoP83D
==========

I was frustrated to not be able to use native autostereoscopic capabilities of my ELEPHONE P8 3D to watch stereophotographs of Phereo website ; so I made this app to display them nicely.

Status: Proof of concept â€” It is working and I might improve depending of my needs

Usage
-----

First, you need this phone, since it is primary intended for it. When the phone is in landscape mode, the app displays itself in column-interleaved to be in 3D thanks to autostereoscopic display.

The app opens "Popular" list at startup.

List view
